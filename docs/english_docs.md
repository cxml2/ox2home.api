## Documentation on API

This API is a response from software engineers for current covid-19 situation in Burma. People are dying everyday due to the lack of oxygen and the military junta's sanctions. Tens of thousands of people are in need to oxygen 25 hours a day and they are struggling to get one. This Restful API shows locations via latitude, longitude and other important information on getting oxygen in Myanmar.
